    "1. **Identified Nested Columns:** First, I identified the columns in my dataset that contained nested data. These were typically columns where each cell may have contained multiple values separated by a delimiter, such as commas or semicolons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Converted Values to Lists:** For each nested column I identified, I converted the values in those columns into lists. This meant each value in the column became a separate element within a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Used the Melt Function:** Once I had converted the nested columns into lists, I used the Pandas melt function. This function reshaped my DataFrame by converting columns into rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Separated Each Element:** During the melting process, each element in the lists was separated into its own row, along with the corresponding values from other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handled Null Values:** To address null values in the dataset, I converted them into a specific string, such as \"missing.\" This ensured uniformity in the data and made it easier to handle missing values during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Merged DataFrames:** After melting all the nested columns, I ended up with multiple DataFrames, each containing the unnested data from one of the original nested columns. I then merged these DataFrames back together to create a single unnested dataset.\n"
